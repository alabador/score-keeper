# Score Keeper
This is a project based on the 'Score Keeper' mini-project in [Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). In this course, this specific project was taught as a code along, but I wanted to try tackling it with only the project brief. Using the knowledge I've learned from the course (as well as using google), this was my solution to the Score Keeper program.

## Overview
In this app, users should be able to:
- Select a score limit
- Increase their score using a button press
- Upon winning, the winner's score should be indicated in green, and the loser's score should be indicated in red.
- On game end, the player's buttons are disabled. 
- Pressing reset will allow the game to start over and reset the buttons and scores. 

## My Process
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JS (conditionals)
- DOM Manipulation
- Events

## What I Learned
One big thing I learned was CSS inheritance. I had forgotten that by setting the display of the parent container to inline-block, I couldn't set the child elements to a different display. 

Another thing I got practice in was DOM Manipulation and events. I'm fairly new to JS and making interactive sites, so it was pretty cool making something interactive. Although not completely original since I am basing this off a course, all of the structure/styles/and logic was created by me.
